![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/joshuapfritz/hak5c2?style=plastic)

This docker file and script have been updated to use a defined hostname using the environment variable "fqdn". If fqdn is not specified, it will revert to the container hostname. The image at [https://hub.docker.com/r/joshuapfritz/hak5c2](https://hub.docker.com/r/joshuapfritz/hak5c2) can be pulled using Docker or Kubernetes. It was created out of the need to generate device configurations using a Fully Qualified Domain Name and publicly accessable domain in a k8s cluster.

The image has also been updated to Alpine 3.21.3, Hak5c2 3.4.0, and related options.

# üêã Alpine based hak5c¬≤ container

This image packs the amazing Hak5C¬≤ software into a secure and light weight alpine-linux based docker container.

Quick start for local tests (assuming your local ip is 192.168.1.1):

```sh
docker volume create c2DB
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 2022:2022 -e db=/home/c2.db -v c2DB:/home --name hak5c2 --hostname=192.168.1.1 lindezagrey/hak5c2
```

## Build options

You can build the image by yourself with any of the provided docker compose files or with the docker build command. This will download the software and build the image.

* Clone or download this repository
* either build the image with ```docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t hak5c2 .```
* or if you use docker compose ```docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build```

Or for a quickstart you can use a prepared image from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lindezagrey/hak5c2) which is based on this repository.

## Deployment options

You can run the image directly with docker or with docker-compose (check the [examples](/examples) folder). It is possible to run the container without a volume, which means everything that is stored in C¬≤ is lost when the container is removed (including loot and licensing). On the other hand you can create a volume and map it so that the c2.db is persistent.

The easiest way to run a container locally (assuming you build it yourself) would be:

```sh
docker run -d --name hak5c2 hak5c2
```

Then you will be able to access the webinterface by navigating to localhost:8080.
To get the setup token you can run:

```sh
docker logs hak5c2 | grep "token"
```

If you want to run it externally accessible (e.g. on a VPS) you have to publish the ports 8080 and 2022 as well.
The application will take the hostname of the container as the hostname argument. So if you made a DNS entry use the FQDN as hostname, if not then the public IP of your server.

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 2022:2022 --name hak5c2 --hostname=test.test.com hak5c2
```

## Environment variables

You can pass all parameters you would normally pass to the application to the container by adding them as an environment variable (except the hostname which is set by the docker "hostname" command):

```sh
docker run -d -e reverseProxy=True -e reverseProxyPort=443 --name hak5c2 hak5c2
```

```sh
Usage of ./c2_community-linux-64:

    	Custom SSL Certificate file (disabled letsencrypt)
  -db string
    	Path to the c2 database (default "c2.db")
  -debug
    	Enable server side debug logs. This will affect performance, only use while actively troubleshooting. Setting this sets -v automatically
  -hostname string
    	 REQUIRED - Hostname of server (ip or DNS name)
